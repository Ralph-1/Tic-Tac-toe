## How To Play

'Tic, Tac, Toe' is a game for two players played on a board with 9 squares.

Each player is represented by a symbol, either 'X' or 'O'. The players then take turns to place their respective symbols in an empty square on the board, with X's going first - in our version of the game, these squares are represented by an empty board.

The following example game is won by the first player, X:

In the event that all 9 squares are taken without either player getting three of their symbols in a line, a draw is declared.
